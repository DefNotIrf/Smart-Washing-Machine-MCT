# Smart-Washing-Machine-MCT

This project is a smart washing machine prototype built with Arduino Uno. It uses multiple sensors and actuators to automate the washing process, improve efficiency, and enhance user interaction.

## Features

- Automatic water level adjustment based on sensor input  
- DC motor control for drum rotation  
- Servo motor for door locking mechanism  
- LCD and 7-segment displays for status and timer  
- Push-button interface for user input  
- Modular breadboard setup for easy testing  

## Components

- Arduino Uno  
- Water level sensor  
- Servo motor  
- DC motor  
- LCD display (I2C)  
- 7-segment display (TM1637)  
- Push buttons  
- Breadboard and jumper wires  

## Folder Structure

- `/code` — Arduino `.ino` sketches  
- `/images` — Photos of the prototype setup  

## How to Use

1. Connect all components accordingly.  
2. Upload the `.ino` file to your Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.  
3. Power the board and use the buttons to control the washing cycles.
